## Amortization

![amortization-equation](../assets/Amortization.gif)


A = periodic payment amount  
P = principal  
i = periodic interest rate  
n = total number of payments  

_ex: 10 year loan for $100,000 at 5% interest_  
P = $100,000  
i = 5%  
n = 120 (10 years of monthly payments)  

## Interest

How to calculate interest vs principal payments:

![interest-payment-equation](../assets/Interest.gif)

I = interest payment  
P = current principal  
i = interest rate  
n = number of payments per year  

## Principal

![current-principal-equation](../assets/Principal.gif)

P1 = new principal  
P0 = current principal  
A = repayment amount  
I = interest payment
